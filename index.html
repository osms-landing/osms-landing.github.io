					<h1>About Us</h1>
				</div>
				<p><a href="https://opensourcemedicalsupplies.org/">Open Source Medical Supplies</a> (OSMS) was formed
					in March
					2020
					to research, medically review, and disseminate open source plans for medical supplies used to treat
					and
					reduce
					the spread of COVID-19 that can be fabricated locally. Additionally, Open Source Medical Supplies
					supports,
					mentors and guides local communities as they self-organize hospital systems, essential services,
					professional
					fabricators, makerspaces, and local governments into resilient, self-supporting supply units.</p>

				<p>In its first two weeks of operation, Open Source Medical Supplies helped organize 62,000 people all
					over the
					world in its Facebook group, supplied plans that volunteers turned into 280,000 medical supply items
					all
					over
					the world, produced an 80+ page long Open Source COVID-19 Medical Supply Guide, and released a
					COVID-19
					Local
					Response Guide that helped local organizers form 95 local chapters all over the world.</p>

				<p>Open Source Medical Supplies teamed up with RESOLVE, Schmidt Futures, Toyota Research Institute, and
					private
					donors to stand up a full-time team to help lead a global, distributed manufacturing response to
					COVID-19.
					OSMS
					collaborates with hospitals, non-profit institutions, governments, professional fabricators and
					makerspaces
					all
					over the world to help direct local fabrication response.</p>
